                    The Hurley Score was created by members of the #keyboards channel of the
                    <a href="https://www.relay.fm/">Relay.fm</a> members' discord as a standardised measure of the size
                    of keyboard collections and descent down the keyboard rabbit hole.

                                <dd>The total number of keyboards you own. A keyboard is a PCB and whatever it is
                                    mounted to/on/in (whether assembled or not). Stand-alone or extra PCBs are counted
                                    as accessories. Macropads and Num Pads are counted as keyboard kits; however, their
                                    switches and keycaps are not counted in their respective categories.</dd>

                                <dt>Unmodified Switch  Sets</dt>
                                <dd>The total number of stock switch sets that you own. A set of switches sufficient
                                    to fill a normal-sized board. Duplicate sets are counted if they were purchased
                                    separately or are used/intended to be used on separate boards.</dd>

                                <dt>Modified Switch Sets</dt>
                                <dd>The total number of customized sets of switches that have been modified by you.
                                    Modified switch sets include those that you have lubed, filmed, or made other
                                    similar modifications to. Clipping switch pins does not count as a modification.
                                    If you make Frankenswitches (where you take components from one set of switches
                                    and use them to replace the components of another set of switches) both sets are
                                    considered modified if both sets have been reassembled. Each set of modified
                                    switches is counted as a single set regardless of the number of modifications
                                    made.</dd>

                                <dd>The total number of keycaps sets you own. If you have multiple kits for the same
                                    set they are all counted as one set unless they can be used to fully kit multiple
                                    boards in which case they are counted as a number of sets equal to the number of
                                    boards they can fully kit simultaneously. Artisan Keycaps are counted as
                                    Accessories.</dd>
